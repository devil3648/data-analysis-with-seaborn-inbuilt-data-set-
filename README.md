○ Use the sample dataset from seaborn ('tips' dataset).
○ Display the first few rows of the dataset.
3. Task: Provide an overview of the dataset.
○ Include data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
4. Task: Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the 'total_bill' column.
5. Task: Calculate the range, variance, and standard deviation of the 'total_bill' column.
6. Task: Create a histogram of the 'total_bill' column.
○ Include a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plot.
7. Task: Create a boxplot for the 'total_bill' column.
8. Task: Create a pairplot for the entire dataset.
9. Task: Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix of the dataset.
○ Use a heatmap for visualization.
10. Task: Perform a t-test to compare the means of 'total_bill' between smokers and
non-smokers.
○ Report the t-statistic and p-value.
